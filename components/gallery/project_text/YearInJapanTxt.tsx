        01 - In 2016 after my studies at the university I wanted dreadfully to
        study Japanese, a dream I had from my childhood where I could ear the
        Japaneses language. Through Tv, Anime, games Song. I recall that during
        late. Middle-school and high-school every day before going to school I
        was speeding to eat my breakfast to be able to watch the TV at least
        20min. During this time there was a little TV channel that was diffusing
        random Japanese songs every morning and i really like the sound of it.

        02 - Even before that i watched on my father computer different animes
        That just came out like One-piece, Bleach, Naruto and so on in the
        original soundtrack subtitle in french or english; with my cousin we
        always had some game of Pokemon and Zelda together. But my very first
        animation movie that make me fall in love for the Japanese animation
        style was Princess Mononoke. I guess it was this gradual accumulation of
        this little thing that gets me to travel to live in Japan from October
        2016 and January 2018.
